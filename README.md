# startdiscord
If you need to have discord on another hard drive or any other drive this script gives you the ability to do so. I made this for myself after making an "on the go" USB to use with any computer where ever I go. 

## Installation
Find where your discord is installed, then move the entire folder onto your other drive.

Once you have discord on another drive, drag and drop this script into the folder with "Update.exe" & "app.ico".

Open the batch file to see if it works!
